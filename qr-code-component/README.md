## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box

### What I learned

CSS FlexBox is a great way to position your elements.
I also learnt about Markdown, because i needed to write this documentation


### Continued development

I hope to get more familiar with CSS FlexBox, CSS Grid and Documentations

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://freecodecamp.org) - This helped me practice my html and css skills
- [Resource 2](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand markdown. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
